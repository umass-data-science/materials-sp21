    "The British Royal Air Force wanted to know how many warplanes the Germans had (some number `N`, a *population parameter*), and they needed to estimate that quantity knowing only a random sample of the planes' serial numbers (from 1 to `N`). We know that the German's warplanes are labeled consecutively from 1 to `N`, so `N` would be the total number of warplanes they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used to investigate the random variation in estimates by simulating sampling from the population many times and computing estimates from each sample.  In real life, if the RAF had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling.  They didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations we did.  So that was useful as an exercise in *understanding random variation* in an estimate, but not as a tool for practical data analysis.\n",

    "Now we'll flip that idea on its head to make it practical.  Given *just* a random sample of serial numbers, we'll estimate `N`, and then we'll use simulation to find out how accurate our estimate probably is, without ever looking at the whole population.  This is an example of *statistical inference*.\n",
