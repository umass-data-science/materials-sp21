That makes it affect the dissimilarity a lot more than other traits.  Two schools that differ in cost-to-attend by \\$900, but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of 900.  But two schools that differ in graduation rate by .9 (a huge difference!), but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of only .9.\n",

For example, we could fix the problem above by multiplying the difference in the cost-to-attend traits by .001, so that a difference of \\$900 in cost-to-attend results in a dissimilarity of $900 \\times .001$, or $.9$.\n",
