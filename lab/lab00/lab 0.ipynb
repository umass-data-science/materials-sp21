Although we will go over information regarding content, grading, and expectations during our first lecture meeting on Tuesday, we would like to take today's lab session to get some logistics out of the way.\n",

To enhance your learning experience we have implemented a system which automatically grades your coding assignments. You'll be able to see whether you are correct or not, and will be able to make check as many times as you need - no penalty! \n",
